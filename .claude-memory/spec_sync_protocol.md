# Sync Protocol Specification

## Clock Lifecycle

### LamportClock
- **tick()**: Called on local writes (create/edit records, migrations). Returns incremented clock.
- **merge(remoteClock)**: Called when receiving remote data. Sets clock = max(current, remoteClock) + 1.
- Process-wide ReentrantLock ensures atomicity across all instances.

### lastPushedClock
Threshold for "dirty" fields. A field is pushed only if `field_clock > lastPushedClock`.

**Advanced at two points:**
1. **Step 5e (before DeltaBuilder)**: Set to maxReceivedClock from remote deltas — ECHO PREVENTION
2. **After successful push**: Set to max clock from pushed deltas

### lastSyncVersion
Latest delta version fetched from Firestore. Advanced after delta fetch.

## Sync Cycle Sequence

```
Step 0:  Pre-checks (stale 90d, version compat, dissolved, removed)
Step 1:  Device registration / snapshot bootstrap / catch-up
Step 2:  Fetch remote deltas (paginated, cursor-based)
Step 3:  Decrypt & deserialize (skip own, skip unreadable)
Step 4:  Per-field CRDT merge + lamportClock.merge(maxFieldClock)
Step 5:  Category dedup & remap (validate→tag dedup→orphan scan→resolve chains)
Step 5e: ADVANCE lastPushedClock past received clocks (ECHO PREVENTION)
Step 6:  Build deltas via DeltaBuilder, chunk at 200, push to Firestore
         → Advance lastPushedClock after push
Step 7:  Update device metadata + integrity fingerprint
Step 8:  Snapshot bookkeeping (write if 100+ deltas since last)
Step 9:  Record lastSuccessfulSync
Step 10: Admin claim check
Step 10.5: Integrity repair (30min interval, quiet cycles only)
Step 11: Receipt cleanup & sync
Step 12: Return SyncResult → SyncWorker saves merged data to JSON
```

## Echo Prevention (Step 5e)

**Problem**: CRDT merge uses maxOf(local, remote) for clocks. After merge, fields have higher clocks than lastPushedClock, making them look "dirty" to DeltaBuilder.

**Solution**: Before DeltaBuilder runs, advance lastPushedClock past all received clocks:
```kotlin
if (maxReceivedClock > lastPushedClock) {
    lastPushedClock = maxReceivedClock
}
```
Now DeltaBuilder only sees genuinely local changes.

## DeltaBuilder Rules

- Include field if `field_clock > lastPushedClock`
- Piggyback critical fields via `ensureField(key, value, clock)` — only if clock > 0 and not already in delta
- Receipt fields respect pendingUploadReceiptIds
- If no fields qualify → return null (no delta)

## CRDT Merge Rules

```kotlin
fun shouldAcceptRemote(localClock, remoteClock, localDeviceId, remoteDeviceId): Boolean {
    if (remoteClock > localClock) return true       // higher clock wins
    if (remoteClock == localClock) return remoteDeviceId > localDeviceId  // tie-break
    return false
}
```

Properties: commutative, associative, idempotent, convergent.

## State Persistence

**SharedPreferences (sync_engine)**: lastSyncVersion, lastPushedClock, lastSnapshotVersion, lastIntegrityCheckTime, catIdRemap, migration flags
**JSON files**: transactions, recurringExpenses, incomeSources, savingsGoals, amortizationEntries, categories, periodLedger, sharedSettings
**Firestore**: deltas (encrypted), device metadata, snapshots, admin claims
**Authentication**: Firebase Anonymous Auth (invisible to user). Required by Firestore/Storage security rules (`request.auth != null`). Sign-in happens on app launch (MainActivity) and before background sync (SyncWorker).

## Security

- All Firestore/Storage access requires `request.auth != null` (anonymous auth)
- Sync deltas encrypted with group 256-bit key (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Pairing code key encrypted with code as PBKDF2 password before Firestore storage
- Debug features (dump button, file uploads, sync_log file, FCM sender) gated behind `BuildConfig.DEBUG`
- Debug uploads encrypted with group key before Firestore storage
- Service account key in debug-only assets (gitignored, never in release APKs)
- Encryption key stored in EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android KeyStore-backed)

## Rescue & Clock-Zero Fix

**Rescue (one-time per app version):** Re-stamps locally-owned records whose field clocks fell behind lastPushedClock. Gated by version flag (e.g., `rescue_stranded_ui_v3_done`). MUST NOT run every cycle — doing so causes push loops and overwrites cross-device edits. Bump flag name only when a code change is known to strand records.

**Clock-zero fix (continuous):** Stamps critical fields with clock==0 on records in the sync system. Needed because CSV import can introduce clk=0 records. Defers clock tick until a record actually needs fixing (no tick if nothing to fix). Does NOT stamp all fields — only the specific ones that are 0.

**CRITICAL RULE:** Never run rescue continuously. Step 5e advances lastPushedClock past received clocks, which makes locally-owned records appear "stranded" even though they were already pushed. A continuous rescue would re-stamp them every cycle → push loop → overwrite remote edits.

## Integrity Check (Fast Mode)

- Runs **every sync cycle** (no 30-minute gate)
- Skips if: we just pushed deltas this cycle, OR waiting for remote to process our last repair
- Fingerprint always published every cycle (not just during checks)
- **syncVersion tolerance**: compare if versions within 10 (not strict equality)
- **Dedup**: fingerprint computation dedups by record ID (prevents phantom divergence from in-memory duplicates)
- **clock=0 exclusion**: `maxClock()` filters out 0-valued clocks (unset fields can't cause divergence)
- After repair push: saves remote fingerprint signature, skips checks until it changes (proves remote synced)
- Both sides repair on clock mismatch (`!=` not just `>`)

## Duplicate Prevention

All transaction add paths must check for existing ID:
- `addTransactionWithBudgetEffect()`: `transactions.none { it.id == stamped.id }`
- Widget disk merge: `memTxnIds` is mutableSet, updated in loop
- `WidgetTransactionActivity.saveTransaction()`: ID check before disk add
- `saveTransactions()`: dedup by ID before writing to disk (safety net)
- `IntegrityChecker.fingerprint()`: dedup by ID before computing (prevents phantom divergence)

## Category Fingerprinting

Tagged categories (e.g., "supercharge", "other") may have different random numeric IDs on each device. The fingerprint computation is **independent of catIdRemap** (which differs per device):
1. Group ALL tagged categories by tag, keep one per tag (highest name_clock)
2. Replace ID with `tag.hashCode() and 0x7FFFFFFF` — deterministic, same on all devices
3. Exclude deleted categories
4. Untagged categories keep their original IDs

This ensures both devices produce identical fingerprints regardless of local ID assignment or remap direction. Do NOT filter by catIdRemap — it differs between devices and produces asymmetric results.

## Key Invariants

1. lamportClock.value >= max(all field clocks, lastPushedClock)
2. After Step 5e: lastPushedClock >= max(received clocks) → no echo
3. Merge is idempotent: re-pushing same delta is safe
4. Tombstone deletion: deleted=true with clock, never remove from list
5. Push threshold: only field_clock > lastPushedClock gets pushed
6. Rescue is ONE-TIME per app version, never continuous
7. No duplicate record IDs in any in-memory list or on-disk file
8. Fingerprint excludes clock=0 fields and dedups by ID

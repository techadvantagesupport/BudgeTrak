When changing Android dependencies on BudgeTrak (adding, removing, or swapping a library), always run `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` instead of plain `assembleDebug`. Gradle's incremental build keeps stale DEX files from the previous dep in the APK even after the dep is removed from `build.gradle.kts`.

**Why:** Hit this debugging an OCR feature — kept getting startup crashes on a supposedly stubbed APK. Turned out prior experiments with `firebase-vertexai` (incompatible with the BOM in use) left their DEX classes in the project dex archive. Incremental builds reused those classes; the app loaded them at startup and crashed against a mismatched Firebase BOM. Clean build dropped ~3 MB of stale DEX and fixed the crash instantly.

**How to apply:**
- Any time `app/build.gradle.kts` dependencies change (add/remove/version bump), run `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`.
- If an APK crashes on startup after a dep experiment, suspect stale DEX before spending time on code bisection.
- Compare APK sizes — a suspiciously large APK vs expected is a sign of stale artifacts.
